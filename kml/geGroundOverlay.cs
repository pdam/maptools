 *      * Initial release
 * 
 * 
 * 2007-02-20: boseefus00001
 *      * Changed all references to geAngleXXX.Value.ToString() to geAngleXXX.ToString().
 *        The geAngleXXX.ToString() Method new overrides it's default behavior and returns an InvariantCulture
 *        string representation of it's Value in order to support other languages.
 *
 * 2007-08-27: boseefus00001
 *      * Added "rotation" to ToKML().  Thanks to peter for pointing out that I missed it.
