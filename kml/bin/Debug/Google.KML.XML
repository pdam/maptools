            Placemark appears as a list item in the Places panel. A Placemark with 
            a Point has an icon associated with it that marks a point on the earth 
            in the 3D viewer. (In the Google Earth 3D viewer, a Point Placemark is 
            the only object you can click or roll over. Other Geometry objects do 
            not have an icon in the 3D viewer. To give the user something to click, 
            you would need to add a Point to the Polygon.)

        <member name="F:Google.KML.geColorStyle.Color">
            <summary>
            Color and opacity (alpha) values are expressed in hexadecimal notation.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            The range of values for any one color is 0 to 255 (00 to ff). For alpha, 00 is fully transparent and ff is fully opaque.
            The order of expression is aabbggrr, where aa=alpha (00 to ff); bb=blue (00 to ff); gg=green (00 to ff); rr=red (00 to ff).
            Default value is ffffffff.
            </remarks>
            <example>
            If you want to apply a blue color with 50 percent opacity to an overlay, you would specify the following: <color>7fff0000</color>, where alpha=0x7f, blue=0xff, green=0x00, and red=0x00. 
            </example>
        </member>
        <member name="F:Google.KML.geColorStyle.ColorMode">
            <summary>
            Values for colorMode are normal (no effect) and random. A value of random applies a random linear scale to the base color as follows.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            To achieve a truly random selection of colors, specify a base color of white (ffffffff). 
            If you specify a single color component (for example, a value of ff0000ff for red), random color values for that one component (red) will be selected. In this case, the values would range from 00 (black) to ff (full red). 
            If you specify values for two or for all three color components, a random linear scale is applied to each color component, with results ranging from black to the maximum values specified for each component. 
            The opacity of a color comes from the alpha component of color and is never randomized. 
            Default value is normal.

            Represents the Geometry abstract class, which
            right at the moment I have no idea why Google
            has done this.  There is no singe thing
            that the objects inheriting this can share.
            There should perhaps be a seperate abstract for 
            Point, LineString, LinearRing, and Polygon so that
            they can at least share some properties.
