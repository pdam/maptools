/*
 * 2006-12-19: boseefus00001 - Initial release
 * 
 * 2007-02-20: boseefus00001
 *      * Added a ToString() overriding method that returns an InvariantCulture string representation
 *        of Value in order to support other languages.  For example some cultures will represent 4.563 as 4,563.  
 *        Since the Google API requires certain comma delimited formatting, especially with coordinates,
 *        this method will make sure the double is represented correctly.
